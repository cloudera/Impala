Subject: [PATCH 130/267] HBASE-13262 Observe ScanResponse.moreResults in
 ClientScanner.

The RS already returns to the client whether or not it has additional
results to be returned in a subsequent call to scan(), but the ClientScanner
did not use or adhere to this value. Subsequently, this can lead to
bugs around moving to the next region too early. A new method was added
to ClientScanner in the name of testability.

Encapsulate server-state into RegionServerCallable to avoid
modifying parameterization of callable impls.

Reason: Bug
